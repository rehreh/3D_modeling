# Summary

I liked DRPrinting3D sensor wall mount ( https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2365762 ) however the space in between the bottom of the sensors threaded stem and where the bolt goes in through the wall mount was too long for most camera mounting bolts to reach plus it wasn't designed in a way that would allow the bolt to hang loose but still secured while not in use like you see in camera mounting gear. The 1/4-20 bolts used in tripods as well as aftermarket custom bolts (like the ones I use in the pictures) are too short to reach the sensor with DRPrinting3D's wall mount. So I just made a more compatible wall mount all together. You can now use most camera retention bolts (1/4-20) just fine, also the size of my mount is a little smaller if you needed to get it into a tighter spot. I used a larger ledge on the inside of the mounting hole to help insure the sensor stem does not pull through even if you tighten it down fairly well. The bolts used for camera gear will work great because they have no threads near the head of the bolt so after they are threaded into the mount they are easily turned however they can not fall out meaning you can put the bolt in the mount before placing it on the wall but still leave the sensor off making it all around easier to mount these how you want with very little trouble. There is a USB pass through hole for you to slip the sensors cable through. There are two holes for mounting screws however the mount also allows the use of command strips if you opt not to drill holes into your walls. I have had three of my sensors held up with command strips for a year now (as of 3/6/2019) and have had no issues with them on the original command strips. The bolts I use work awesome in this mount and you can get a pack of 5 really cheap on Amazon ---> http://a.co/0Ay9tZB . If you print this, please upload a pic to the "I Made One" tab. I love seeing my designs get printed :) Thanks!
